## üõñ Welcome to the Links Hut Repo!

My intention is to complete a _Linktr.ee_ clone to include as part of my dev portfolio. Initially I have thought of the following features:

> [!summary]+ Note summary on this
> This is the actual content of the summary for the note


> <span style="color: red; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic">DISCLAIMER:</span>  I don't have a _Linktr.ee_ acount, so I don't know what it actually does ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

- Login / Signup 
	- Do I need a security levels setup? Is it enough to have just the user as Admin?
	- Could add a ***limited*** user account, but don't see the point yet.
- Add, Remove, Edit a Link test
- Upload Profile Picture
- Background selecition:
	- Select from Unsplash
	- Upload a file
	- Use a color
- Select style from templates
	- Include at least 3 style templates to select from
	- MAYBE SOMEDAY: Allow upload of custom CSS (need a template for this)
- Add/Edit the page description
- Add/Edit the page title
- Add/Remove/Edit social media buttons

### Agile and Scrum ‚è∞

> I need to organize and prioritize  my work, so what better way then Scrum.

The idea is to make use of the artifacts and events as described by the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide). I will be creating User Stories for each feature, creating a backlog, working in sprints, developing a Definition of Done, and performing some semblance of estimation.

I will keep most of the documentation here, and provide links to any additional sites or apps that I  use. 

For now i will use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)as my project management solution.
